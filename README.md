# Playground App - Flutter template

This repository contains a pure Flutter project. It is part of the [_IOTA for Flutter_](https://iota-for-flutter.github.io/tutorial) Tutorial and belongs to the chapter [_Building a Comprehensive App_](https://iota-for-flutter.github.io/tutorial/building-a-comprehensive-app/whats-the-result.html).

It serves as the Flutter template from which a complete Flutter-Rust app is built in the tutorial. In terms of functionality, the app executes several examples which refer to different Rust libraries from IOTA.
