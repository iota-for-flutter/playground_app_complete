# Playground App - complete

---

Our target is to create a playground app to execute some Rust example from the IOTA foundation, using the IOTA SDK and the identity library.

---

This repository contains the completed source code, after all implementation steps for Android and iOS. It is part of the [_IOTA for Flutter_](https://iota-for-flutter.github.io/tutorial) Tutorial.

In terms of functionality, the app allows users to create an account wallet (rocksdb), a Stronghold snapshot file, an address, request some funds and check the balance, and finally to test the creation of a Decentralized Identifier - all using the Shimmer Test-Network.

## Usage of the repository

I recommend setting up the project from scratch. I don't have experience in downloading the repository and magically getting it up and running with a single install command. That's why I refer you to the tutorial and the series of videos explaining the build process. Start with the chapter:

You also need to follow the instructions in the chapter:
